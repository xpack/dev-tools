In september 2024, the **xPack 3rd Party Development Tools** web sites were
moved to their corresponding projects in `xpack-dev-tools`
and HTML `<meta>` redirects were left
in the old locations.

Since the release blog posts had URLs in the top xPack site they could not be
moved, therefore HTML `<meta>`
redirects were added there.
