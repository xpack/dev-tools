In september 2024, the **xPack 3rd Party Development Tools** web sites were
moved to their corresponding projects in `xpack-dev-tools`
and HTML `<meta>` redirects were left
in place.

Since the release blog posts had URLs in the top xPack site, they could not be
moved, therefore HTML `<meta>`
redirects were added there.

## Deprecated pages

Several pages were deprecated and were not migrated to the new sites,
thus were not redirected:

- [https://xpack.github.io/dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc/python/]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/arm-none-eabi-gcc/python/)
- [https://xpack.github.io/dev-tools/qemu-arm/gnuarmeclipse/]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/qemu-arm/gnuarmeclipse/)
- [https://xpack.github.io/dev-tools/qemu-arm/options/]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/qemu-arm/options/)
- [https://xpack.github.io/dev-tools/xbb-bootstrap/]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/xbb-bootstrap/)
